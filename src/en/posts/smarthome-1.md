When home automation just seems to work, it is always the result of hard work. Home automation is fascinating and requires a considerable investment of your time. Here are some key considerations especially for new users. To be successful, you will need to:

- Be prepared to learn
- Remain flexible in how you want to achieve your goal
- Celebrate all the small successes
